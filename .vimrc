"" Cheat Sheet
""  Code Folding:
""      zR - Open all folds
""      zM - Close all folds
""      zc - Close one fold under the cursor
""      zC - Close all folds under the cursor recursively
""      zo - Open one fold under the cursor
""      zO - Open all folds under the cursor recursively
""      zv - Open just enough folds to make the line in which the cursor is located not folded
""      zj - Jump to start of next fold
""      zk - Jump to end of previous fold
""  Window Navigation:
""      CTRL-h - Move cursor to window left of current one
""      CTRL-j - Move cursor to window below current one
""      CTRL-k - Move cursor to window above current one
""      CTRL-l - Move cursor to window right of current one
""  Searching:
""      SHIFT-8 - search for word under the cursor
""      n - go to next search result
""      SHIFT-n - go to previous search result
""  Buffer Navigation:
""  ( For easy buffer navigation I use the minibufexpl.vim plugin at
""    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=159 )
""      :e <file> - edit <file> in a new buffer
""      :ls - list current buffers
""      :b <part of file name> - switch to buffer with TAB completion
""      :bn - next buffer
""      :bp - previous buffer
""      CTRL-6 - switch to previously used buffer
""      #-CTRL-6 - switch to buffer number #
""      :b # - switch to buffer number #
""      :bd # - delete buffer number #
